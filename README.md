# 👨🏻‍💻 checkLMS
### A python script that checks if new material was uploaded on LMS
The script mainly depends on the progress bar.
It checks if it's below 100% then there is new stuff that you didn't check.
Otherwise, you're OK and there is nothing new.

Please check [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to be able to run the script smoothly.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you had any problems running the application.
